## Interview Prep

We’re building an “Interview Prep” guide that’s relevant and up to date. Here’s what we’re looking for:

1. **Interview Questions**  
   - Questions *you’ve been asked* in interviews.  
   - Questions *you ask applicants* if you conduct interviews yourself.  
   - Tech questions, behavioral questions, problem-solving exercises—anything goes!

2. **Interview Strategies**  
   - Tips for phone screens, in-person interviews, or virtual interviews.  
   - **Resume advice**: how to tailor your resume for specific roles.  
   - **Portfolio/GitHub strategies**: how to showcase your projects and skills.  
   - **Negotiation advice**: how to discuss salary, benefits, and more.

3. **Success Stories**  
   - **How you landed your interview**: networking tactics, LinkedIn optimization, cold-email strategies, etc.  
   - **What got you hired**: personal branding, references, side projects, open-source contributions, or “extra” skills that sealed the deal.
