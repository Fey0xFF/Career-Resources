## Interview Prep

We’re building an “Interview Prep” guide that’s relevant and up to date. Here’s what we’re looking for:

1. **Interview Questions**  
   - Questions *you’ve been asked* in interviews.  
   - Questions *you ask applicants* if you conduct interviews yourself.  
   - Tech questions, behavioral questions, problem-solving exercises—anything goes!

2. **Interview Strategies**  
   - Tips for phone screens, in-person interviews, or virtual interviews.  
   - **Resume advice**: how to tailor your resume for specific roles.  
   - **Portfolio/GitHub strategies**: how to showcase your projects and skills.  
   - **Negotiation advice**: how to discuss salary, benefits, and more.

3. **Success Stories**  
   - **How you landed your interview**: networking tactics, LinkedIn optimization, cold-email strategies, etc.  
   - **What got you hired**: personal branding, references, side projects, open-source contributions, or “extra” skills that sealed the deal.

Feel free to break down your contributions by role or industry (e.g., SOC Analyst, Security Engineer, Pen Tester, etc.).

## On the Job Insights

This section highlights real-world experiences from professionals in specific roles.

1. **Role Write-ups**  
   - A day in the life of a SOC Analyst, Security Consultant, Threat Hunter, etc.  
   - Specific tasks you handle daily (e.g., investigating alerts, setting up detection rules, etc.).

2. **Technologies & Tooling**  
   - Break down the tools you use, why you use them, and how they fit into your workflow.  
   - Infrastructure and environment tips (cloud platforms, SIEMs, EDRs, ticketing systems).

3. **Example Tasks & Processes**  
   - Step-by-step processes for common job duties (log analysis, triaging alerts, incident response procedures).  
   - Templates or checklists that others can adapt to their own environments.

Sharing your real-world experiences helps students and early-career professionals understand what the day-to-day is really like in different cyber roles.

## Skilling Up

   - Who it’s best suited for: entry-level, intermediate, or advanced.  
   - Study strategies, recommended resources, and personal experiences.

2. **Learning Paths & Roadmaps**  
   - Curated lists of online courses, reading materials, or labs that helped you build in-demand skills.  
   - Specific domain-based paths (e.g., Cloud Security, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence).
